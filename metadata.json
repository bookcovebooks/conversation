  "description": "In a Texas town where deadly quarrels are settled with guns and justified by honor, young Curly Stewart faces an impossible choice: flee before a notorious gunman returns to kill him, or stand his ground despite knowing he can't outdraw his opponent. When Jim Begley forces a showdown after Curly criticizes his cowardly killing methods, Curly must rely on something deadlier than a fast draw—nerve-shattering conversation that turns the tables on a man who once hid behind a bulletproof vest.",
